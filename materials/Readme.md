# Learning Materials

The learning materials of secure federated learning. For anyone who wants to understand the theorey behind codebase, please reading the docs here.

The code of this repositiry is not constrained to a particular program language, rather we want to use language as tools to achieve our goals. Therefore, we want to utility cutting-edge cryptograh tools and privacy protection methods.

## Rust Learning

Rust recent years has become a popular tool to implement cryptography algorithms due to its strict memory protect technique.
